               <h1> About Me </h1>
                              My name is Florence Ogunbore, an awesomness of God's creation, i hail from the mega city of 
                             Lagos state. I'm dark skinned, pretty and awesome. I enjoy surfing the net, particularly 
                             reading up on things that fascinates me, from history to crime documentary to trending news, 
                             I enjoy seeing movies in my spare time, I enjoy listening to songs{RnB,Soul,Hiphop are my favs},
                             I'd say I also enjoy eating too.LOOOOL, it's what it is. 
                               A while ago, i took interest in the coding world, i had earlier heard about it in 'Game Shakers'
                             a sitcom on Nickelodeon ooh i think i forget to mention that I also enjoy watching cartoons too, a really 
                             big cartoon enthusiast. Anyway, the sitcom centers around two girls that own a gaming company, one of the 
                             girls codes and make the games they sell. It looked surreal at first but i read up more on it and even loved
                             it more. I definetly think coding is one thing I'd enjoy doing as well.
                              Of course, i love my friends and family.
